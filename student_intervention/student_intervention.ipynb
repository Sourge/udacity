    "The Problem is choosing the right learner and distribution for the problem and can be quite hard. You might need domain knowdlege to really opmitimize the model. You also need to find weak learners which consistently archieve higher accuracy than random guessing.\n",

Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
